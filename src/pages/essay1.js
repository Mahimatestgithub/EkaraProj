          The difference between being a founder and being an idea person is critical in the startup world. Many individuals have ideas—flashes of inspiration about a new product or service—but transforming an idea into a successful business takes a founder's mindset. Founders are those who don't just dream, but execute. They are the ones who relentlessly push their ideas forward, learning from failures, adapting to market needs, and continuously improving their products or services.
        </p>
        <p>
          Being an idea person is an important step; after all, every great venture begins with a vision. However, the role of a founder involves taking on the challenge of turning that vision into a reality. It requires leadership, strategic thinking, resilience, and the willingness to take risks. Founders understand that execution is just as important—if not more—than the idea itself. They are able to rally a team, secure funding, and navigate the complexities of business growth, while idea people may often find themselves stuck in the conceptual phase.
        </p>
        <p>
          In essence, while every founder starts as an idea person, not every idea person becomes a founder. If you want to make an impact, ask yourself: are you ready to move beyond ideas and take actionable steps toward building something real?
