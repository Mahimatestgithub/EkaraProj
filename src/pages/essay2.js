        <p>
        An idea is the seed of every successful business or innovation. But not all ideas are created equal. In the entrepreneurial context, an idea is more than just a thought—it’s a blueprint for change. It either introduces a new way of doing things or brings about a completely new innovation.
        </p>
        <p>
        A process-based idea focuses on refining or reimagining how tasks are performed. For example, companies like Uber redefined transportation by changing how we access rides. These ideas don’t always create something entirely new, but they streamline and optimize existing processes for efficiency, convenience, or accessibility. On the other hand, an innovation-based idea introduces something completely new—a product, technology, or service that didn’t exist before. These breakthrough ideas often lead to entirely new markets, like the smartphone did for mobile communication.            </p>
    
        <p>
        Ultimately, an idea’s strength lies in its ability to address a problem or meet a demand in a unique and valuable way. Whether it’s a new process or a groundbreaking invention, an idea must have the potential to create meaningful impact.</p>
