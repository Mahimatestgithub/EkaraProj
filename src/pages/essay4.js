        Once you’ve confirmed that your idea is worth pursuing, the next step is planning. A well-thought-out plan acts as a roadmap, guiding your startup through each phase of development.
        </p>
        <p>
        Begin by outlining your vision—the overarching goal of your business. What do you hope to achieve, and how will your product or service impact the market? This vision will guide every decision you make.
        </p>
        <p>
        Next, break down your vision into tangible goals. These should be specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART goals). For example, instead of “gain users,” a SMART goal would be “acquire 1,000 new users within six months.”
        </p>
        <p>
        Your planning process should also include a business model that outlines how your company will generate revenue. Will you charge customers directly, offer a subscription service, or perhaps use advertising? Knowing how you will make money is critical to your long-term success.   
        </p>
        <p>
        Finally, you’ll need to create a timeline that tracks milestones—when will you launch, when will you scale, and what benchmarks will you use to measure success? Planning also involves preparing for unforeseen challenges and having contingency plans in place to manage risks effectively.
